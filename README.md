---

FileSurfer is an open-source Windows file explorer built with Avalonia UI.
FileSurfer is designed for convenience and efficiency, targeting more technical users while still providing a familiar and modern interface.
I've also included features that I personally find useful, even if they're not commonly found in other file explorers.
Your feedback is very welcome: if you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please open an issue here on GitHub!
